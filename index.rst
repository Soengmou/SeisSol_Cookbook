This documentation is a collection of useful dynamic simulation examples to help users build models from the scratch with little efforts. Each example is demonstrated carefully with geometry building, parameter setup and result visualization. Users are suggested to repeat each example in order to get a comprehensive idea of how to set up dynamic simulation models with SeisSol. The updates of source software and news of SeisSol should be posted in SeisSol or 

Characteristics of the SeisSol simulation software are:

- use of tetrahedral meshes
- to approximate complex 3D model geometries and rapid model generation
- use of elastic, viscoelastic and viscoplastic material to approximate realistic geological subsurface properties
- use of arbitrarily high approximation order in time and space
- to produce reliable and sufficiently accurate synthetic seismograms or other seismological data set
