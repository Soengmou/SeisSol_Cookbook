This documentation is a collection of useful simulation examples to help users build dynamic rupture model from the scratch with little efforts. Each example is demonstrated carefully with 1) geometry building, 2) parameter setup,  and 3) result visualization. Users are suggested to repeat each example in order to get a comprehensive idea of how to set up dynamic simulation with SeisSol. The updates of source software and news of SeisSol should be posted in SeisSol GitHub (https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol) or Readdocs(https://seissol.readthedocs.io/en/latest)

Overview of SeisSol:

The software package SeisSol (http://www.seissol.org/) allows for
realistic simulations of the three-dimensional seismic wave field
propagating in complex Earth structures generated by a finite dynamic
earthquake source governed by a constitutive law that describes the
relationship between fault stress and slip along a geometrically complex
fault. The software package is available to
the community as an open source distribution
(`www.github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol <www.github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol>`__).
