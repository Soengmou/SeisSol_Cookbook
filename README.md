# SeisSol_Cookbook
This is the cookbook for the software package SeisSol (https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol).

SeisSol is still under heavy development and comes without any guaranteed funcitonality. At the moment we can only provide very limited support for general users. Please contact Alice Gabriel if you are interested in a close collaboration.

For further information on running SeisSol and a first example see our [Documentation] (https://seissol.readthedocs.io)
