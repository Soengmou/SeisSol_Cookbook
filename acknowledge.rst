===============

SeisSol is still under heavy development and comes without any guaranteed funcitonality. At the moment we can only provide very limited support for general users. Please contact Alice Gabriel (gabriel@geophysik.uni-muenchen.de) if you are interested in a close collaboration.

For further information on running SeisSol and a first example see our [Documentation] (https://seissol.readthedocs.io)
