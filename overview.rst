overview
========

SeisSol is a part of SCEC dynamic code validation project
:raw-latex:`\citep{harris2018}`. Here we show several SCEC benchmarks
for beginners to quickly catch up with SeisSol workflow. Each benchmark
example is composed of a short problem description, a section of
*geometry, initial setups (stress, nucleation, friction, etc.)*, and
*simulation results*.
